:question: Cool facts about the film:
1. **Scientific Collaboration** - To ensure the scientific accuracy of the film, renowned physicist Kip Thorne was brought on board as an executive producer. Thorne's work on black holes and gravitational physics influenced the depiction of these phenomena in the movie.
2. **Accurate Black Hole** - The visualization of the black hole, Gargantua, in the film is based on real scientific equations and simulations provided by Kip Thorne. The team at Double Negative, the visual effects company, worked closely with Thorne to accurately represent the warping of spacetime around a massive object.
3. **Practical Effects** - Director Christopher Nolan is known for his preference for practical effects over CGI. Many of the spacecraft interiors, including the Endurance spaceship, were built as practical sets, allowing the actors to interact with tangible elements during filming.
4. **Real Cornfield** - The cornfield seen in the film was planted specifically for the movie, and it later became a sustainable crop. After filming, the corn was sold, and the profits were used to cover some of the production costs.
5. **Relativity of Time** - The film explores the concept of time dilation due to gravity, a real phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. This adds a unique and scientifically grounded element to the storytelling.
